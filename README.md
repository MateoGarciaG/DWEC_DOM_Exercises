# DWEC_DOM_Exercises
This project is related to DWEC assignature to do DOM exercises of "Panel de Actividades"

## Terrarium Exercise
The font code HTML, CSS and Images was taken from 
the original repository to complete the tasks required by
this exercise following the README instructions:

https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/blob/main/3-terrarium/3-intro-to-DOM-and-closures/README.md

This decision was taken because I only want to focus on manipulating DOM and make Events for assignature DAWEC, but obviously if I do HTMl, CSS and images probably take more time to prepare the scenario to begin the exercise
